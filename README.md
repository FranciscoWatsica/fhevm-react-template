# Privacy Pet DNA Matching System

A revolutionary blockchain-based platform for privacy-preserving pet breeding compatibility matching. This system enables pet owners to find optimal breeding partners while keeping sensitive genetic information completely private and encrypted.

---

## üéØ Core Concept

**Privacy Pet DNA Matching** - A pet breeding compatibility system that matches the best breeding partners **without revealing specific genetic information**, preventing hereditary diseases through encrypted genetic analysis.

Traditional pet breeding platforms expose sensitive genetic data, creating privacy risks and potential discrimination. Our system uses Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to perform complex genetic compatibility calculations on encrypted data, ensuring that:

- ‚úÖ Pet genetic markers remain encrypted on-chain
- ‚úÖ Health scores and temperament data stay private
- ‚úÖ Compatibility matching happens without data exposure
- ‚úÖ Only final match results are revealed to owners
- ‚úÖ Hereditary disease risks are minimized through smart matching

---

## üî¨ How It Works

### 1. **Encrypted Pet Registration**
Pet owners register their pets with sensitive data that gets encrypted before being stored on the blockchain:
- Genetic markers (3 unique DNA identifiers)
- Health score (0-100 rating)
- Temperament score (behavioral compatibility)
- Basic public info (name, breed, age)

All sensitive data is encrypted using Zama's fhEVM technology and never exposed in plain text.

### 2. **Privacy-Preserving Matching**
When requesting a compatibility match between two pets:
- Both pets' encrypted genetic data is processed on-chain
- Homomorphic operations calculate compatibility scores
- Health compatibility, temperament matching, and genetic diversity are analyzed
- All computations happen on encrypted data without decryption

### 3. **Secure Results**
After encrypted computation:
- Only the final compatibility score (0-100) is revealed
- Match threshold of 70%+ indicates good breeding compatibility
- Original genetic data remains permanently encrypted
- Pet owners can make informed decisions without exposing private information

## üèóÔ∏è Smart Contract Architecture

### Core Contract: PetDNAMatching

```solidity
contract PetDNAMatching is SepoliaConfig {
    struct Pet {
        uint256 id;
        address owner;
        string name;
        string species;
        string breed;
        uint256 birthYear;
        euint8 healthScore;          // Encrypted
        euint16 geneticMarker1;      // Encrypted
        euint16 geneticMarker2;      // Encrypted
        euint16 geneticMarker3;      // Encrypted
        euint8 temperament;          // Encrypted
        bool availableForBreeding;
    }

    struct MatchResult {
        uint256 requestId;
        uint256 petId1;
        uint256 petId2;
        uint8 compatibilityScore;    // Revealed result
        bool isMatched;              // Score >= 70%
        uint256 matchTime;
    }
}
```

### Key Functions

- `registerPet()`: Encrypt and store pet's genetic data
- `createMatchingProfile()`: Set encrypted breeding preferences
- `requestMatching()`: Initiate compatibility analysis (payable)
- `processMatchingResult()`: Gateway callback for results
- `getPetInfo()`: Retrieve non-sensitive pet information
- `getPetMatches()`: View match history

## üîê Privacy Features

### Data Encryption
All sensitive pet data is encrypted using Zama's fhEVM:

```javascript
// Frontend encryption example
const healthScore = 85; // Private health score
const marker1 = 12345;  // Private genetic marker

// Encrypted on-chain storage
euint8 encryptedHealth = FHE.asEuint8(healthScore);
euint16 encryptedMarker = FHE.asEuint16(marker1);
```

### Encrypted Operations
Compatibility calculations use homomorphic operations:

```solidity
// Calculate health compatibility (encrypted)
euint8 healthSum = FHE.add(pet1.healthScore, pet2.healthScore);

// Calculate temperament difference (encrypted)
euint8 temperamentDiff = FHE.sub(pet1.temperament, pet2.temperament);

// Request decryption only for final result
FHE.requestDecryption([healthSum, temperamentDiff], callback);
```

### Access Control
- Pet owners can only access their own encrypted data
- Contract has computation permissions only
- No third party can decrypt genetic information
- Gateway API v2.0+ ensures secure decryption

## üßÆ Compatibility Scoring Algorithm

The system calculates compatibility using three factors:

### 1. Health Compatibility (50 points max)
- Both pets' health scores combined
- Higher combined score = better compatibility
- ‚â•160: 50 points | ‚â•140: 40 points | ‚â•120: 30 points

### 2. Temperament Compatibility (30 points max)
- Difference between temperament scores
- Lower difference = better compatibility
- ‚â§2: 30 points | ‚â§4: 20 points | >4: 10 points

### 3. Genetic Diversity (20 points base)
- Ensures breeding variation
- Prevents inbreeding risks

**Total Score**: 0-100 points
**Match Threshold**: ‚â•70 points indicates good breeding compatibility
